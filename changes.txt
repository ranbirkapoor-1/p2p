normal call is working properly but when i click group call button it does not do any action. it is disabled 
i dont need group call button as extra button merge group call and normal calls. 
if 2 peers are there then normal call if > 2 AND <=4 then use mesh network if > 4 peers then disable call, video call buttons
- write changes in fixes_implemented.md and push to git
