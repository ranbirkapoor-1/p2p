the audio is audible across all devices now. very nice job

in call between two peers earpiece should be default selected (speaker in the top) in group call the loud speaker should be default
add a button on call and group call screen to switch audio between earpiece, speaker and bluetooth (if connected and supported)
group call disconnect button not working

- write changes in fixes_implemented.md and push to git
