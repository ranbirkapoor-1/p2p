### âš« GRAY (Paused)
**When it shows:**
- Tab has been inactive for 30+ seconds
- Connections are paused to save resources

**What it means:**

## Peer Count Display

### Format: `X users (Status)`

**Examples:**

1. **"Not connected"**
   - You haven't joined a room yet

2. **"Connecting..."**
   - Joining room, waiting for user list

3. **"Alone (1 user)"**
   - You're the only one in the room
   - Status: GREEN (connected to Firebase)

4. **"2 users (All P2P)"**
   - 2 total users (including you)
   - Fully connected via P2P
   - Status: GREEN

5. **"3 users (1/2 P2P)"**
   - 3 total users in room
   - Connected to 1 out of 2 other peers
   - Status: YELLOW (partial connection)

6. **"4 users (No P2P)"**
   - 4 users in room
   - Lost all P2P connections
   - Status: RED (disconnected)
   - Reconnect button visible

## Reconnect Button

**When it appears:**
- You're in a room with other users
- You've lost ALL P2P connections
- Firebase connection may or may not be active

**What it does:**
- Rejoins the SAME room
- Keeps your nickname
- Re-establishes P2P connections

**When it's hidden:**
- During active connection attempts
- When fully connected
- When you're alone in the room
- When not in any room

## Connection Flow

### Joining a Room:
1. Enter room â†’ Status: YELLOW
2. Connect to Firebase â†’ Peer count updates
3. Establish P2P â†’ Status: GREEN

### When Someone Joins:
1. New user appears â†’ Peer count increases
2. Status: YELLOW (if was GREEN)
3. P2P established â†’ Status: GREEN

### When Someone Leaves:
1. User leaves â†’ Peer count decreases
2. P2P connection closed
3. Status remains GREEN if others connected

### Connection Lost:
1. P2P fails â†’ Status: RED
2. Peer count shows "(No P2P)"
3. Reconnect button appears

### Tab Switching:
1. Tab hidden <30s â†’ No change
2. Tab hidden >30s â†’ Status: GRAY (paused)
3. Tab active â†’ Resumes automatically

## Technical Details

### Connection Priority:
1. **Firebase (Signaling)**: Required for room presence
2. **WebRTC (P2P)**: Required for messaging/calls
3. **Both needed**: For full functionality

### Status Decision Logic:
```
IF not in room â†’ RED
ELSE IF alone in room â†’ GREEN (Firebase only)
ELSE IF connected to all peers â†’ GREEN
ELSE IF connected to some peers â†’ YELLOW
ELSE IF have peers but no P2P â†’ RED (with reconnect)
ELSE â†’ RED
```

### Peer Count Logic:
```
Total Users = All users in Firebase room (including self)
Other Peers = Total Users - 1
P2P Connected = Active WebRTC connections
Display = "Total users (P2P status)"
```
