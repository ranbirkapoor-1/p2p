## Recent Major Updates (Latest Session)

### üîß Firebase Connection Issues (FIXED)
**Problem**: Firebase wasn't creating rooms and P2P connections weren't being established.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Missing global Firebase instance (`window.firebaseHandler` not created)
2. Method signature mismatch in `sendSignal()` function
3. Conflicting Firebase handler files

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created global instance in `firebase-handler.js`
- Fixed `sendSignal()` to support both call signatures (2 and 4 arguments)
- Removed conflicting instance creation from backup file
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### üîÑ Manual Reconnection System (COMPLETELY REDESIGNED)
**Problem**: Complex automatic reconnection was not needed; user wanted simple manual reconnect only.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Removed all automatic reconnection logic**:
   - Deleted `ReconnectionManager` class usage
   - Removed reconnection-manager.js from HTML
   - No more health checks, timers, or automatic retries

2. **Implemented clean manual reconnection**:
   - Single "Reconnect" button that appears when connection is lost
   - Complete cleanup and rejoin process
   - Fresh user ID generation on each reconnect

3. **Fixed Ghost User Issue**:
   - Old user IDs are now cleaned up from Firebase after reconnecting
   - Prevents duplicate/ghost users in the room
   - Cleans up both `/users/` and `/signals/` references

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Peer Count Display (FIXED)
**Problem**: Peer count was showing incorrect numbers, not counting self or starting from 0.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the peer count logic in `updatePeerCount()` method
- Now correctly shows:
  - "You (1 user)" when alone
  - "2 users", "3 users" etc. when others join
  - Includes self in the total count
- Fixed bug where `count` variable was undefined (changed to `connectedCount`)

### 2. ‚úÖ Tab Switching with 30-Second Timeout (IMPLEMENTED)
**Problem**: No timeout when users switch tabs, wasting resources.

**Solution**:
- Added page visibility detection
- 30-second grace period when tab is hidden
- Automatic pause/resume of connections
- Visual "paused" state indicator
- Connections resume automatically when tab becomes active

### 3. ‚úÖ Peer Connection Mesh for Group Calls (FIXED)
**Problem**: In a 3-person room, only peers 1-2 connected, peer 3 remained isolated.

**Solution**:
- Fixed connection logic to ensure full mesh network
- Added connection check to avoid duplicate connections
- Added random delay for existing users to avoid connection storms
- Now all peers connect to each other properly

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-Peer Video Display Grid (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Status**: HTML and CSS updated, JavaScript logic needs completion

**What's Done**:
- Created grid layout CSS for multiple video streams
- Updated HTML structure to support video grid
- Added responsive grid that adjusts based on participant count
- Added video labels for each peer

**What's Needed**:
- Update CallHandler to manage multiple peer streams
- Implement dynamic video element creation/removal
- Handle stream addition/removal for each peer
- Test with actual group calls

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Retry Button for Disconnected Peers (EXISTING FEATURE)
**Status**: Already implemented as "Reconnect" button

**Current Behavior**:
- Reconnect button appears when connection is lost
- Allows rejoining the same room
- Already visible only to disconnected peers

- **NEW**: Added ghost user cleanup after reconnecting
- **NEW**: Enhanced logging for debugging connection issues

### 2. firebase-handler.js
- **NEW**: Added global instance creation (`window.firebaseHandler = new FirebaseHandler()`)
- **NEW**: Fixed `sendSignal()` method to support both 2 and 4 argument signatures
- **NEW**: Enhanced initialization with detailed logging
- **NEW**: Added connection test during initialization
- Improved error handling and logging throughout

### 3. webrtc-handler.js

### 6. index.html
- Updated call interface structure for video grid
- Added label for local video
- **NEW**: Removed reconnection-manager.js script tag

### 7. firebase-handler-backup.js
- **NEW**: Disabled global instance creation to prevent conflicts

### 8. Created Debugging Tools
- **test-firebase.html**: Tests basic Firebase operations
- **check-firebase-rules.html**: Verifies Firebase database permissions
- **debug.html**: Comprehensive debugging console for the app

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Firebase Connection**:
   - Open `debug.html` and run all diagnostic tests
   - Verify Firebase can read/write to database
   - Check that rooms are created properly

2. **Test Manual Reconnection**:
   - Join a room with 2+ users
   - Disconnect network/kill one peer
   - Click "Reconnect" button
   - Verify no ghost users remain
   - Confirm P2P connections re-establish

3. **Test Peer Count**:
   - Join a room alone - should show "You (1 user)"
   - Have others join - should show correct total count

4. **Test Tab Switching**:
   - Switch tabs for <30 seconds - should resume normally
   - Switch tabs for >30 seconds - should pause and resume

5. **Test Group Connections**:
   - Have 3+ users join a room
   - Check browser console to verify all peers connect to each other
   - Each peer should see connection messages for all others

6. **Test Group Video Calls** (Needs Implementation):
   - Start a video call with 3+ participants
   - Verify all video streams display in grid
   - Test with different numbers of participants

## Next Steps

To complete the group video call feature:

1. **Refactor CallHandler.js**:
   ```javascript
   // Need to update methods to handle multiple streams:
   - startCall() - initiate calls to all connected peers
   - handleIncomingCall() - accept calls from multiple peers
   - addPeerStream() - add video element for new peer
   - removePeerStream() - remove video element when peer leaves
   - updateVideoGrid() - adjust grid layout based on participant count
   ```

2. **Update WebRTC Stream Handling**:
   - Maintain separate peer connections for media
   - Handle multiple incoming/outgoing streams
   - Sync video display with active call participants

3. **Test Scenarios**:
   - 2-person call upgrading to 3-person
   - Peer leaving during active call
   - Network interruptions during group call
   - Mute/unmute with multiple peers

## Known Limitations

1. **Group Calls**: Currently limited to 1-to-1 calls, group call UI is ready but logic needs implementation
2. **Max Peers**: Limited to 4 peers per room (configurable in config.js)
3. **Bandwidth**: Multiple video streams may cause bandwidth issues
4. **Mobile**: Group video calls may not work well on mobile devices due to resource constraints
