## [2025-09-26 19:12:45] - Unified Call System with Smart Peer Detection

**Problem** (From changes.txt):
1. Group call button was disabled and did nothing when clicked
2. Separate group call button was unnecessary - needed unified calling
3. No automatic switching between normal and group calls based on peer count
4. No limit enforcement for maximum participants

**Solution**:
Implemented smart call system that automatically switches between call types based on peer count:

1. **Removed separate group call button**:
   - Deleted group call button from index.html
   - Simplified UI to just audio and video call buttons

2. **Unified call logic in CallHandler**:
   - 0 peers: Buttons disabled, shows "No peers connected"
   - 1 peer: Normal 1-to-1 call (both audio and video enabled)
   - 2-3 peers (3-4 total): Group audio call with mesh network (video disabled)
   - 4+ peers (5+ total): All calls disabled, shows "Too many participants"

3. **Smart call routing**:
   - `startCall()` now detects peer count and routes to appropriate handler
   - Automatically uses GroupCallHandler for 3-4 participant calls
   - Clear user feedback with dynamic button tooltips

4. **Dynamic button state management**:
   - New `updateCallButtonStates()` method in app.js
   - Buttons enable/disable automatically as peers join/leave
   - Tooltips update to show current capability

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html` - Removed group call button
- `js/call-handler.js` - Added smart call routing based on peer count
- `js/app.js` - Added dynamic button state management

## [2025-09-26] - CSS Consolidation, UI Improvements, and Bug Fixes

**Problems**:
1. Multiple CSS files scattered across the project making maintenance difficult
2. No way to close the browser tab from the UI
3. lastSeen functionality causing reconnection issues - users rejoining were treated as existing users
4. Group call button was disabled and non-functional

**Solutions**:

- Updated `index.html` to reference only the consolidated CSS file
- Deleted redundant CSS files for cleaner project structure

### 2. Added Close Tab Button
- Added close button (×) in the header with `window.close()` functionality
- Styled with red background matching reconnect button theme
- Shows informative message when browser security prevents closing user-opened tabs

### 3. Removed Problematic lastSeen Functionality
- Removed all lastSeen/heartbeat code from `firebase-handler.js`:
  - Eliminated 30-second interval updates
  - Removed lastOnlineRef tracking
  - Removed lastSeen field from user data structure
- Now relies solely on Firebase's onDisconnect() handler
- Fixes issue where rejoining users couldn't establish P2P connections

### 4. Fixed Group Call Button
- Added proper event listener setup in `group-call-handler.js`
- Button now gets reference during initialization

## [2025-01-25 18:57:32] - Complete Room Cleanup Fix

**Problem**:
When all users leave a room without messages, the room wasn't being completely deleted from Firebase. The `lastOnline` data was remaining in the database structure like:
```
rooms
>AAAA
>lastOnline
>user-aifya8cmv:1758872007326
```

**Solution**:
Enhanced the room cleanup logic in `firebase-handler.js` to:
1. Remove ALL non-message data when no users are present
2. If room has messages, keep only messages and delete all other data (typing, signals, lastOnline, etc.)
3. If room has no messages and no users, delete the entire room completely

**Files Modified**:
- `js/firebase-handler.js` - Enhanced leaveRoom() cleanup logic
- `js/version.js` - Updated to v1.0.4
- `index.html` - Updated version display

**Version**: v1.0.4

**Testing Notes**:
- Rooms should now be completely removed when empty
- Only message data persists when room has chat history
- No orphaned data like lastOnline should remain

## Recent Major Updates (Latest Session)

### 🔧 Firebase Connection Issues (FIXED)
**Problem**: Firebase wasn't creating rooms and P2P connections weren't being established.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Missing global Firebase instance (`window.firebaseHandler` not created)
2. Method signature mismatch in `sendSignal()` function
3. Conflicting Firebase handler files

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created global instance in `firebase-handler.js`
- Fixed `sendSignal()` to support both call signatures (2 and 4 arguments)
- Removed conflicting instance creation from backup file
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 🔄 Manual Reconnection System (COMPLETELY REDESIGNED)
**Problem**: Complex automatic reconnection was not needed; user wanted simple manual reconnect only.

**Changes Made**:
1. **Removed all automatic reconnection logic**:
   - Deleted `ReconnectionManager` class usage
   - Removed reconnection-manager.js from HTML
   - No more health checks, timers, or automatic retries

2. **Implemented clean manual reconnection**:
   - Single "Reconnect" button that appears when connection is lost
   - Complete cleanup and rejoin process
   - Fresh user ID generation on each reconnect

3. **Fixed Ghost User Issue**:
   - Old user IDs are now cleaned up from Firebase after reconnecting
   - Prevents duplicate/ghost users in the room
   - Cleans up both `/users/` and `/signals/` references

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Peer Count Display (FIXED)
**Problem**: Peer count was showing incorrect numbers, not counting self or starting from 0.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the peer count logic in `updatePeerCount()` method
- Now correctly shows:
  - "You (1 user)" when alone
  - "2 users", "3 users" etc. when others join
  - Includes self in the total count
- Fixed bug where `count` variable was undefined (changed to `connectedCount`)

### 2. ✅ Tab Switching with 30-Second Timeout (IMPLEMENTED)
**Problem**: No timeout when users switch tabs, wasting resources.

**Solution**:
- Added page visibility detection
- 30-second grace period when tab is hidden
- Automatic pause/resume of connections
- Visual "paused" state indicator
- Connections resume automatically when tab becomes active

### 3. ✅ Peer Connection Mesh for Group Calls (FIXED)
**Problem**: In a 3-person room, only peers 1-2 connected, peer 3 remained isolated.

**Solution**:
- Fixed connection logic to ensure full mesh network
- Added connection check to avoid duplicate connections
- Added random delay for existing users to avoid connection storms
- Now all peers connect to each other properly

### 4. ⚠️ Multi-Peer Video Display Grid (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Status**: HTML and CSS updated, JavaScript logic needs completion

**What's Done**:
- Created grid layout CSS for multiple video streams
- Updated HTML structure to support video grid
- Added responsive grid that adjusts based on participant count
- Added video labels for each peer

**What's Needed**:
- Update CallHandler to manage multiple peer streams
- Implement dynamic video element creation/removal
- Handle stream addition/removal for each peer
- Test with actual group calls

### 5. ⚠️ Retry Button for Disconnected Peers (EXISTING FEATURE)
**Status**: Already implemented as "Reconnect" button

**Current Behavior**:
- Reconnect button appears when connection is lost
- Allows rejoining the same room
- Already visible only to disconnected peers

### 8. Created Debugging Tools
- **test-firebase.html**: Tests basic Firebase operations
- **check-firebase-rules.html**: Verifies Firebase database permissions
- **debug.html**: Comprehensive debugging console for the app

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Firebase Connection**:
   - Open `debug.html` and run all diagnostic tests
   - Verify Firebase can read/write to database
   - Check that rooms are created properly

2. **Test Manual Reconnection**:
   - Join a room with 2+ users
   - Disconnect network/kill one peer
   - Click "Reconnect" button
   - Verify no ghost users remain
   - Confirm P2P connections re-establish

3. **Test Peer Count**:
   - Join a room alone - should show "You (1 user)"
   - Have others join - should show correct total count

4. **Test Tab Switching**:
   - Switch tabs for <30 seconds - should resume normally
   - Switch tabs for >30 seconds - should pause and resume

5. **Test Group Connections**:
   - Have 3+ users join a room
   - Check browser console to verify all peers connect to each other
   - Each peer should see connection messages for all others

6. **Test Group Video Calls** (Needs Implementation):
   - Start a video call with 3+ participants
   - Verify all video streams display in grid
   - Test with different numbers of participants

## Next Steps

To complete the group video call feature:

1. **Refactor CallHandler.js**:
   ```javascript
   // Need to update methods to handle multiple streams:
   - startCall() - initiate calls to all connected peers
   - handleIncomingCall() - accept calls from multiple peers
   - addPeerStream() - add video element for new peer
   - removePeerStream() - remove video element when peer leaves
   - updateVideoGrid() - adjust grid layout based on participant count
   ```

2. **Update WebRTC Stream Handling**:
   - Maintain separate peer connections for media
   - Handle multiple incoming/outgoing streams
   - Sync video display with active call participants

3. **Test Scenarios**:
   - 2-person call upgrading to 3-person
   - Peer leaving during active call
   - Network interruptions during group call
   - Mute/unmute with multiple peers

## Known Limitations

1. **Group Calls**: Currently limited to 1-to-1 calls, group call UI is ready but logic needs implementation
2. **Max Peers**: Limited to 4 peers per room (configurable in config.js)
3. **Bandwidth**: Multiple video streams may cause bandwidth issues
4. **Mobile**: Group video calls may not work well on mobile devices due to resource constraints
